The colors library supports the NO_COLOR standard out of the box.

In case you wish to also enable automatic output of colors based on the
terminal being interactive (TTY), call enable_auto_colors in your 
src/initialize.sh. You may run the following command to add this file:

  $ bashly add hooks

+ bundle exec bashly add completions
created src/my-libz/send_completions.sh

In order to enable completions in your script, create a command or a flag (for example: cli completions or cli --completions) that calls the send_completions function.

Your users can then run something like this to enable completions:

  $ eval "$(cli completions)"
