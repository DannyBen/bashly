created src/lib/colors.sh

The colors library supports the NO_COLOR standard out of the box.

In case you wish to also enable automatic output of colors based on the
terminal being interactive (TTY), call enable_auto_colors in your 
src/initialize.sh. You may run the following command to add this file:

  $ bashly add hooks

created src/download_command.sh
created ./cli

# This file is located at 'src/download_command.sh'.
