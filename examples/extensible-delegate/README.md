# Extensible Delegate Command Example

Demonstrates how to configure an external delegate command that will be called
(with all the arguments) whenever an unknown command is invoked.

This example was generated with:

```bash
$ bashly init
# ... now edit src/bashly.yml to match the example ...
$ bashly generate
```

# respective `git status` and `git log` commands.
