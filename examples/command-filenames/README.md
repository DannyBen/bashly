# Command Filenames Example

Demonstrates how to specify custom filenames for command source files.
This is useful for scripts with many commands, in case you wish to organize
your source files in sub-folders.

Note that the specified path is relative to the `sec` folder.

This example was generated with:

```bash
$ bashly init
# ... now edit src/bashly.yml to match the example ...
$ bashly generate
```

-----

## `bashly.yml`

```yaml
name: cli
help: Demonstrate custom command filenames
version: 0.1.0

commands:
- name: dir
  short: d
  help: Directory commands

  commands:
  - name: list
    help: Show files in the directory
    
    # Define a custom filename for this command source.
    # This is relative to the `src` directory, and sub-directories will be
    # created as needed.
    filename: dir_commands/list.sh

  - name: remove
    help: Remove directory
    filename: dir_commands/remove.sh

- name: file
  short: f
  help: File commands

  commands:
  - name: show
    help: Show file contents
    filename: file_commands/show.sh

  - name: edit

    filename: file_commands/edit.sh
