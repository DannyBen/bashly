# Help Command Example

Demonstrates how to add a `help` command to your script. This is only needed
if you prefer to have the `your-cli help COMMAND` syntax in addition to the 
natively supported `your-cli COMMAND --help` syntax.

This example was generated with:

```bash
$ bashly init
$ bashly add help
# ... now edit src/bashly.yml to match the example ...
$ bashly generate

```

<!-- include: src/help_command.sh -->
