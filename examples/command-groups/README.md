# Command Groups Example

Demonstrates how to visually group commands under their own caption. This is
useful for scripts that contain many commands that provide different sets of
functionality.

This example was generated with:

```bash
$ bashly init
# ... now edit src/bashly.yml to match the example ...
$ bashly generate
```

## `bashly.yml`

````yaml
name: ftp
help: Sample application with command grouping
version: 0.1.0
