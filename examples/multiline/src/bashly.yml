  Multiline test
  
  This is a multiline test example. Long lines are going to be properly wrapped at the 80 character mark.

version: 0.1.0

commands:
- name: multiline
  
  # Using the YAML multiline marker allows you to define help messages with 
  # multiple lines
  help: |-
    Do some multiline work.

    This is a long process and takes time, therefore it takes a lot of lines to describe and this line is particularly long.

    But - not all hope is lost. Bashly should respect newlines and word-wrap long lines properly at the 80 character mark.

  args:
  - name: my_arg
    help: |-
      Argument with multiline.

      Once again we gather here to prepare some long lines that will most likely seem silly to anyone who reads them.

      But, it is just needed for testing - otherwise, it will not only be silly, but it will also be buggy!

  flags:
  - long: --long
    help: |-
      Long flag with long text.

      Finally, this will be the last multiline string we type (hopefully), but once we are done with this, we will be done with all.

- name: regular
  help: Standard help line

  args:
  - name: repo
    help: Repository name

examples:
  - |-
    Examples can also use multiple lines. This can be useful if we need to explain the example, for instance like we are doing here:

      multi multiline --flag

environment_variables:
- name: multi_vitamin
  help: |-
    Environment variables can also use multiple lines. This can be useful if we need to explain - in excruciating detail - what the environemnt variable is used for.
