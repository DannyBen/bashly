# Environment Variables Example

Demonstrates how to specify that your script supports (or requires) certain
environment variables. This can be configured at any command level(root command
or sub commands).

This example was generated with:

```bash
$ bashly init
# ... now edit src/bashly.yml to match the example ...
$ bashly generate
# ... now edit src/verify_command.sh ...
$ bashly generate
```

<!-- include: src/verify_command.sh -->

-----

## `bashly.yml`

````yaml
name: cli
help: Sample application that requires environment variables
version: 0.1.0

# This option adds usage text to the help message in the generated script.
environment_variables:
- name: api_key
  help: Set your API key

commands:
- name: verify
  alias: v
  help: Verify your user

  # This option belongs to the `verify` command and will appear in its help
  # message.
  environment_variables:
  # Setting `required: true` will halt the script's execution with a
  # friendly error message, unless the variable is set.
  - name: my_secret
    help: Your secret
    required: true
  
  # Using the `default: value` option will cause the value to variable to be 
  # set if it is not provided by the user.
  - name: environment
    help: One of development, production or test
    default: development

## `src/verify_command.sh`

echo "environment:"
echo "- API_KEY=${API_KEY:-}"
echo "- ENVIRONMENT=${ENVIRONMENT:-}"
echo "- MY_SECRET=${MY_SECRET:-}"
