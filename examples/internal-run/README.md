# Internal Run Example

This example demonstrates how to use the `run` function to call commands
internally, using the exact same syntax as a user would in the CLI. This
approach can be useful for chaining commands or reusing logic without
duplicating code.

This example was generated with:

```bash
$ bashly init
# ... now edit src/bashly.yml to match the example ...
$ bashly generate
# ... now edit the generated command files to match the example ...
$ bashly generate
```

Note that while this pattern of calling `run` internally is supported, you may
want to consider using [lib functions]
instead, for a more robust codebase.

While this pattern of calling run internally is supported, you may want to
consider using [lib functions](https://bashly.dev/usage/writing-your-scripts/#adding-common-functions)
instead. lib functions can help create a more robust and maintainable codebase
by centralizing reusable logic.
