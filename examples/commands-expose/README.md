# Commands Expose Example

Demonstrates how to show the summary help of subcommands in the `--help`
message of their parent command.

This example was generated with:

```bash
$ bashly init
# ... now edit src/bashly.yml to match the example ...
$ bashly generate
```

-----

## `bashly.yml`

````yaml
name: cli

commands:
- name: init
  help: Start a new project

- name: config
  help: Config management commands

  # Setting `expose` to true will show the summary of the subcommands when
  # using `cli --help` for the parent command. In this case, `config edit` and
  # `config show` will be displayed.
  expose: true
  commands:
  - name: edit
    help: Edit config file
  - name: show
    help: Show config file

- name: server
  help: Server management commands
  
  # Setting `expose` to `always` will also show the summary of the subcommands
  # when running `cli` without arguments.
  expose: always

  # Adding a `group` works well with `expose`. In this case, `server start` and
  # `server stop` will be listed under `Cluster Commands`.
  group: Cluster

  commands:
  - name: start
    help: Start the server
  - name: stop
    help: Stop the server

- name: container
  alias: c
  help: Container management commands
  expose: true
  group: Cluster
  commands:
  - name: exec
    help: Run a command in the container
  - name: down
    help: Terminate a container
