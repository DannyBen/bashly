# Reusable Flags Example

Demonstrates how to use YAML anchors to apply the same flags to multiple
commands. Note that this is a standard YAML feature, and is not bashly specific.

This example was generated with:

```bash
$ bashly init
# ... now edit src/bashly.yml to match the example ...
$ bashly generate
```

-----

## `bashly.yml`

````yaml
name: cli
help: Sample application
version: 0.1.0

commands:
- name: download
  help: Download a file

  # Label these flags (&force, &debug) so we can reference them later
  flags:
  - &force
    long: --force
    short: -f
    help: Overwrite existing files

  - &debug
    long: --debug
    short: -d
    help: Show debug information

- name: upload
  help: Upload a file

  # Reuse previously defined flags, and then add new ones
  flags:
  - *force
  - *debug
  - long: --password
    short: -p
    arg: password
    help: Password to use for logging in
